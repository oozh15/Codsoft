Problem Statement
 Tic-Tac-Toe against a human player. The AI uses algorithms such as Minimax with or without Alpha-Beta Pruning to ensure it is unbeatable. 

Approach Taken:
The game board is a 3x3 grid implemented as a 2D list.Player ('X') and AI ('O') take alternate turns.
The AI evaluates all possible moves to maximize its chance of winning and minimize the player's winning chances. The AI considers all future moves and ensures no winning opportunity is left for the player.
The player enters a row and column in a single line, like 1 2 (row 1, column 2). Input is validated to avoid errors.
The game ends when either player wins or the board is full draw

Tools/Libraries Used
Python 3.x
Math Library

How to Run the Code
Install Python 3.x 
Copy the code into  tictactoe.py
Run python tictactoe.py




Chatbot that can answer common queries about a temple, such as timings, pooja schedules, and footwear storage.

Approach:
 Rule-Based System where predefined rules match user queries to appropriate responses.
User input is converted to lowercase and extra spaces are removed for efficient keyword matching.
If the input contains keywords like "timing," "pooja," or "footwear," the bot provides specific responses.
For unrecognized queries, a polite fallback response is triggered.
A loop ensures multiple interactions, ending only when the user inputs "exit" or "quit."

Tools:
Python Standard Library
input() (for user input)
String methods: lower(), strip()

How to Use:
bot will prompt you to ask a question,Type your query  "What time is the evening pooja?",The bot will respond based on the keywords or type "exit" to end the conversation.









Problem Statement:
 simple recommendation system that suggests items (e.g., movies, books, or products) to users based on their preferences. This script employs content-based filtering, where recommendations are filtered by attributes such as category, duration, price, and rating based on user input.

Approach Taken:
The system suggests courses based on user-specified attributes 
Filters relevant items by matching user preferences to dataset attributes.
Accepts user preferences 
Validates inputs and handles errors gracefully.
Dummy evaluation metrics (RMSE and MAE) provide an idea of prediction accuracy using sample ratings.

Tools/Libraries Used:
Pandas.
NumPy
scikit-learn

How to Run the Code:
 Python is installed.
Install required libraries: pandas, numpy, scikit-learn 
Place the CSV file in the specified directory.
Run the script 
Displays filtered recommendations based on the given preferences
